Description:

This module provides an integration with Authorize.net’s CIM (Customer Information Manager) API.
This allows customers to save payment and credit card information to Authorize.net’s servers,
 allowing the convenience of stored credit cards without the burden of increased PCI compliance needs on the part of
 the e-commerce website.
